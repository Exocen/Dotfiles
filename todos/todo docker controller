associated with mail error (msmtp or direct container) INTERNAL AND SYSTEMD
should be called at start
should start containers
check every container status (+ healthcheck)
no more container with restart
ydl + glueten controller : ydl must restart WITH glueten (new relay every up)
mail -> container error
auto-restart ?
